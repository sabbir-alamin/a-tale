Some of the most famous and widely read classic short stories of all time are:

Shirley Jackson’s The Lottery (1948),
Edgar Allan Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart (1843), 
Flannery O’Connor’s A Good Man Is Hard to Find (1953).

It's a great list.

Edgar Allan Poe is my personal favorite.
Edgar Allan Poe was an American writer, poet, editor, and literary critic best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.
